# Karl's .tmux.conf
This is good old tmux.conf with some (hopefully) clear comments. It's worked out
well for me at least. If you feel like it, give it a try!

## Features
- Use <C-s> as your tmux key. 
- Use <C-s a> to enter Copy Mode. 
- Use Vim controls wherever possible (copy mode, window and pane manipulation). 

## Installation
1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/karlfloersch/tmux.conf.git ~/.tmux/` 
2. Make a symlink to the tmux.conf file with `ln ~/.tmux/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf`
3. Run tmux! You're good to go! The config file lives in ~/.tmux/tmux.conf, so edit that or
the symlink to it for further customization.

Feel free to git pull if you feel like getting my updated changes 

## Maintenance
I'm going to update this whenever I feel like it... so if these links become out of date,
or whatever else, then I'm sorry. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
